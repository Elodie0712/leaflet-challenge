# Other Markers

In this activity, you'll create three vector shapes to use as markers.

## Instructions

* Use the starter files `index.html`, `logic.js`, and `style.css` provided in the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder. Create the following vector layers, and then add them to the map:

* A red circle over the city of Dallas (`[32.7767, -96.7979]`)

* A line connecting NYC (`[40.7128, -74.0060]`) to Toronto (`[43.6532, -79.3832]`)

* A polygon that covers the area inside Atlanta (`[33.7490, -84.3880]`), Savannah (`[32.0809, -81.0912]`), Jacksonville (`[30.3322, -81.6557]`), and Montgomery (`[32.3792, -86.3077]`)

## Hint

* Note that the [logic.js](Unsolved/logic.js) file contains some starter code.

* Use the Vector Layers section of the [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#toc) for reference.
