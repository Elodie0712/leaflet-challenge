# City Population Layers

In this activity, you'll expand on a previous activity by adding an overlay to represent state populations. This layer will appear on the map as white circle vectors.

## Instructions

* Use the starter files `index.html`, `logic.js`, and `style.css` provided in the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder.

* Open the [logic.js](Unsolved/logic.js) file in the `Unsolved` folder.

* Add logic to this file as follows:

    * Create a layer group for city markers and a separate layer group for state markers. Note that the `cityMarkers` and `stateMarkers` arrays contain all the markers, which have been created for you. Store these layer groups in variables named `cities` and `states`.

    * Create a `baseMaps` object to contain the `street` and `topo` tiles, which have already been defined.

    * Create an `overlayMaps` object to contain the `State Population` and `City Population` layers.

    * Add a `layers` key to the options object in the `L.map` method, and set its value to an array that contains our `street`, `states`, and `cities` layers. These will determine which layers display when the map first loads.

    * Create a layer control, and pass it the `baseMaps` and `overlayMaps` objects. Add the layer control to the map.

## Hint

* Refer to the Leaflet [Layer Groups and Layers Control tutorial](http://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control/) if you need help.

* If everything is correct, you can toggle between the Street Map and Topographic Map base layers and turn the State Population and City Population overlays on and off.
