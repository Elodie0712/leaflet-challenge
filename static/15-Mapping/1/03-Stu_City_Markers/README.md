# City Markers

In this activity, you'll create a map and plot markers for five United States cities.

## Instructions

* Use the starter files `index.html`, `logic.js`, and `style.css` provided in the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder.

* Add markers to your map  for the following US cities:

| City | Latitude | Longitude |
|---|---|---|
| New York | 40.7128 | -74.0059 |
| Los Angeles | 34.0522 | -118.2437 |
| Houston | 29.7604 | -95.3698 |
| Omaha | 41.2524 | -95.9980 |
| Chicago | 41.8781 | -87.6298 |


* For each city, create a marker with a popup that displays the city's name and population. You can either look up the population for each city or make one up for this exercise.

## Bonus

A popup takes a string of HTML. If you finish early, try experimenting with passing different tags or custom CSS.

## Hint

Don't forget to add the marker to your map after creating it.
