# Rodent Report Map

In this activity, you'll visualize reports of rodent sightings in New York City (NYC).

## Instructions

* Use the starter files `index.html`, `static/js/logic.js`, and `static/css/style.css` provided in the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder.

* Check out [the data for all 311 (police non-emergency) service requests in NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data).

* Build a query URL for the data that only returns rodent complaints from 2016.

    **Note:** To start, limit the data that's returned to 100 data points.

* After you successfully plot your rodent data, incorporate the [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) plugin.

    **Note:** Cluster plugins can help to declutter a map that has tons of data on it.

## Bonus

If you finish plotting the rodent-sighting data on the map, use the 311 service requests data to plot a similar graph for a different type of data.

## Hint

You can increase the data limit to 10,000 after you get the cluster plugin working. But, be aware that plotting 10,000 normal markers on a map might slow down your computer a lot.
